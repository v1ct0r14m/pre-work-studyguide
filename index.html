          <li>[ position: relative; ] uses the top and bottom properties to vertically offset and the left and right properties to hroizontally offset the element from the static position</li>
          <li>[ position: absolute; ] removes the element from the natural flow of the page aelements and uses the top, bottom, left, and right properties to offset relative to the element's parent, or containing, element's margins</li>

          <li>to create a for loop you will need to follow 3 important statements:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>var x = 0; this will be the starting point, declaring a variable and giving it the value of 0 [bc the first index of an array is always 0]</li>
              <li>x < name.length; this will be the condition, and the 'length' will run through each index so long as the variable x is less than the length of the array</li>
              <li>x++ : this will be the final statment, which is a shortcut way of writing x+1, meaning every time the code loops, x will increase by 1</li>
            </ol>
          <ul>
            <li>for loop application will look something like this: for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++), with a code block in curly brackets after</li>
