          <li>to create a for loop you will need to follow 3 important statements:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>var x = 0; this will be the starting point, declaring a variable and giving it the value of 0 [bc the first index of an array is always 0]</li>
              <li>x < name.length; this will be the condition, and the 'length' will run through each index so long as the variable x is less than the length of the array</li>
              <li>x++ : this will be the final statment, which is a shortcut way of writing x+1, meaning every time the code loops, x will increase by 1</li>
            </ol>
          <ul>
            <li>for loop application will look something like this: for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++), with a code block in curly brackets after</li>
